 			<p> the amazing life of Snehal Pandey, your favorite indian named Snehal</P>
			<p> here's a few links and pictures of some projects I've done in girls who code: </p>
			<p><font color="blue">FISH TANK PROJECT</font></p>
			<p> My first project I want to talk about (in the link below titled "fish tank") is my fish tank project,
			which I did on a website called "Khan Academy" which has a computer program similar to javascript. 
			In this program, I drew some fish, a treasure chest, and a sandy back
			ground.</p>

			<p><font color="purple">HAIKU GENERATOR</font></p>
			<p> another project I did was a random haiku generator, which I did in a computer program
			called "python". I made this program to be able to randomly generates 3 lines of funny haikus!</p>

			<p><font color="pink">PIG GAME</font></p>
			<p> One of my personal favorites was when I made the made a game called pig on
			a program called "scratch", and it was the most fun to make because not only
			was the game very fun and playable, but it also looks really cute and creative in terms
			of drawing!</p>
